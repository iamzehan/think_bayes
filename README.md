## Think Stats 
___
A personal endeavor towards Bayesian Statistics. 

``It is advised to also use 'pen and paper' to keep track of the equations or some of them might make your head hurt.``

This repository contains the study materials, personal remarks and experimental aspects of the book Titled: _**'Think Bayes - Bayesian Statistics in Python (2nd Edition)'**_, written by Allen B. Downey & published by [O'REILLY Media](https://www.oreilly.com/)

___

## Chapter 1: Probability
Covers the basics of Probability with conjunctions, conditionals & laws of probability. The reader is taken through the Chapter with an Example Titled: 'Linda the Banker' involving the famous experiment by Tversky and Kahneman. The chapter takes on a single dataset and examines different aspects of it under different probabilistic theories.

**Keywords:** *conjunction, condition, commutative, probability.*
___

## Chapter 2: Bayes' Theorem
This chapter continues after the Bayes' Theorem described briefly in the former. 
Three main problems are used as examples to devise the further explanation of **Bayes' Theorem**
1. Cookie Problem: Using Bayes' Original Theorem.
2. Dice Problem: Using **Bayes Tables** and **Diachronic Bayes**
3. Monty Hall Problem: Using **Bayes Tables** and **Diachronic Bayes**

**Keywords:** *prior, likelihood, posterior, total probability, normazlization.*
___

## Chapter 3: Distributions
A python library called `empiricaldist` and it's extended class [**Probability Mass Function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) which comes as named `Pmf` is extensively used in this chapter. Empirical distribution basically gives us distributions based on the data as opposed to theoretical distributions that we devised in examples the earlier chapters. Also several problems from [Chapter 2](https://github.com/iamzehan/think_bayes/blob/main/README.md#chapter-2-bayes-theorem) e.g. The Cookie Problem, Dice Problem etc. are also revisited using this distribution and it goes on show how theoretical inference differentiate and is intrecately connected to the everchanging data.
