Here's how the rules of the game plays out:\n","\n","* The host, Monty Hall, shows you three closed doors - numbered 1, 2, and 3 - and tells you that there is a prize behind each doors. \n","* One prize is valuable (something like a car), the other two are less valuable  (for humourus purposes - goats) .\n","* The object of the game is guess which door has the valuable item. If you guess right, you can keep the prize.\n","\n","Suppose you, in your mind chose the Door 1 and Monty opens a door other than your choice, eg. door 3 and shows you there is a goat. Then monty offers you whether you want to stick to your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n","\n","How do you maximize your chances between Door 1 and Door 2?\n","\n","To answer the question, let's make up some assumptions about the behaviour on the host:\n","\n","1. Monty always opens a door and offers you the option to switch.\n","2. He never opens the door you picked or the door with the car.\n","3. If you choose the door with the car, he chooses one of the other doors at random.\n","\n","Under these assumptions, you better switch because hypothesis has changed after we have seen one the items behind the door. Prior, it was 1/3, now if you switch you win 2/3 of the time.\n","\n","You might think that I have two doors left and the chances of winning is 50% thus, implying that it doesn't matter if I switch or stick to my answer. But you are utterly wrong.\n","\n","Let us use the help of a Bayes Table to devise this argument, so that it helps us culminate a better chance.\n","\n","We'll start with the three Doors hypothesis as `prior`"],"metadata":{"id":"8o-PlVZDd72v"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["table3=pd.DataFrame(index=['Door 1','Door 2', 'Door 3'])\n","table3['prior']=Fraction(1,3) # Before we have seen anything behind the door\n","table3"],"metadata":{"id":"3np05jqpdTUD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654594998973,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Ziaul Karim","userId":"08392030995732291798"}},"outputId":"055a1eb7-44e3-43e5-fd46-0571aecf1eef"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       prior\n","Door 1   1/3\n","Door 2   1/3\n","Door 3   1/3"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-68205aad-e52e-492e-be68-f0d633625fe5\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>prior</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Door 1</th>\n","      <td>1/3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Door 2</th>\n","      <td>1/3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Door 3</th>\n","      <td>1/3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-68205aad-e52e-492e-be68-f0d633625fe5')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-68205aad-e52e-492e-be68-f0d633625fe5 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
